# ARK Invest ETFs Holdings Monitoring and Reporting Automation

## Project Overview

Our client, a stock advisory company, provides services including stock market analyses, stock monitoring, and stock recommendations. They have a growing demand from their clients for news about ARK Invest ETFs funds, particularly regarding the buying and selling activities of CEO Cathie Wood.

Currently, the process involves manual monthly retrieval of ARK Invest ETFs' holdings data from their website, followed by comparison with the previous month's data in Excel. The resulting differential analysis is then emailed to clients.

The objective of this project is to automate this process to enhance efficiency and provide timely updates to clients.

## Key Features

- Automated retrieval of ARK Invest ETFs' holdings data from the website.
- Differential analysis to identify new, increased, and reduced positions.
- Generation of a report summarizing the changes in holdings.
- Automatic email delivery of the report to clients.
- Agile approach to accommodate evolving requirements and ensure customer satisfaction.
